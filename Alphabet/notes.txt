- Trying to combine Alphabet output with TWanalyzer.py
- TWanalyzer.py accessed rate information at the following locations

240: ModFile = ROOT.TFile(di+"ModMassFile_rate_"+options.cuts+".root")
- Used to find a mass weight 
- Found by dividing the normalized post top tag t mass distribution by the normalized pre top tag t mass distribution
	- Fixes the shape of the mass distribution
- range of 0.6 to 1.75
- Still necessary?
	- Would need to ...

378: TTR = TTR_Init('Bifpoly','rate_'+options.cuts,setstr,di)
- This takes in the text files outputed from the rate maker to recreate the fits within the analyzer
- Later used to do the background weighting (TTRweight)
- Alphabet outputs similar text files - can probably alter output of these to match TWrate output
	- NEED TO CHANGE FROM BIFPOLY TO POL2

396: TagFile1 = TFile(di+"Tagrate"+setstr+"2D_rate_"+options.cuts+".root")
- The file is made by the rate maker and is a comparison between tpt and Mtw (2D plots but also parameterized in 2 eta regions, so 3D)
- Used to weight the 2D Qcd bkg (important since it is a propagated error)
