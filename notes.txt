Differnces from Kevin's files:
TWrate.py
	- I call HT900 and JET450 triggers but doesn't really matter since I have trigger turned off
	- Kevin lines 565-573 are going to use trigger weights from the HT800 trigger
		- This should be okay because we're in the plateau and weights will just be 1 but should ask
		- Changing mine to look like his
	- Changed binning to Kevin's
	- Left in doneAlready

Bstar_Functions.py
	- 35867.0 for lumi in Kevin's (36420 in mine) (changed mine but didn't make a difference so changed back)
	- changed wsf to 1.0
	- Changed sjbtag from [0.80,1.0] to [0.46,1.0]
	- Did not change wmass from [65.0,95.0] to [65.0,105.0]
	- Changed Masslabel to be for PuppiMass rather than PuppiCorrectedsoftDropMass

TWanalyzer_plotter.py
	- Doesn't have changes from Kevin but I commented out a lot of kinematics stuff and needs to be visited

TWrate_Maker.py
	- Kevin has singletop turned off



Long-term fixes and updates
- W and top tagging scale factors (X)
- pt reweighting (?)
- PDF uncertainties (X)
- Rerun slimtuples (X)
- Cross sections + uncertainties
- QCD Parameterization uncertainty
- Study effect of new cuts
- tau21 v tau32 comparison (X)
- Try binned Mt correction (X)
- Rp/f(top pt v Mt) - [fit of Rp/f(top pt) * fi of Rp/f(Mt)]

1. [DONE] Need to check STtWB has finished running
2. [DONE] Need to do Eos2d3Gen.py in /uscms_data/d3/lcorcodi/BStar13TeV/SlimTuples and then move files over with myEos2d3.csh
3. [Need to ask Kevin about GenEventInfo] Need to run ttree maker
4. [Kevin is running it]Need to figure out why trigger is 100% efficient
5. [DONE] Need to try running TWpileup
6. [DONE] Need to run brillCalc for data

- look at "W mass" in sideband1 (Mtstack)
