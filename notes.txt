Ask marc about SF
Look into Rp/f of sideband1 to figure out QCD plateau
Check your iterations are correct

Compare pileup distributions of QCD vs ttbar


Theta does the simultaneous fit

QCD and Pass-fail ratio with ttbar not subtracted
QCD and Pass-fail ratio with ttbar subtracted twice

QCD MC Disagreement
- The t-jet is talking to the w-jet
- 

Last things you did
- Submitted four different cut selections for rate WITH sjbtag requirement
- Without sjbtag, rp/f jumped to ~35%
--- This makes the discrepancy between the modeled Rp/f and the cheat smaller by percentage (and maybe even magnitude?) and so estimate should improve
- Before you jump the gun, need to see Rp/f WITH the sjbtag requirement and make those plots before proceeding without the requirement
